# Learning resources for MAPS

## The scope of this guide

This guide is aimed at anyone looking to develop participatory teaching/training in food systems thinking to improve dietary micronutrients, using the MAPS tool as part of the learning activity.

We provide examples used in university undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, and professional training, during the MAPS project. These examples are not intended to be prescriptive, but to guide the use of MAPS in similar settings elsewhere.

We also summarise our training resources for the R language, in which our “offline” modelling development has taken place, and which underpins modelling in the MAPS tool itself.

The MAPS tool has been developed to meet the previously unmet needs of users for an “easy to use” system that does not require extensive training; we see this as an advantage in an educational setting as well, because it should maximise the time in which learners at all stages can focus on their understanding and interpretation of the data presented, rather than learning how to use the tool.

## Accessing the MAPS tool

The MAPS tool can be accessed directly from <https://maps.micronutrient.support/> or <https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool>, and via our shortcut <https://www.maps.africa/>. All three links lead to exactly the same version of the tool.

The MAPS tool has been optimised for screen sizes typically found with desktop and laptop devices, rather than smaller mobile devices. Using smaller devices is possible, but will not provide the intended user experience of the interfaces. The tool will work in widely used commercial operating systems and web browsers (as at 2024).

Access is free of charge and does not require users to log-in. Users of the full scope of functionality, i.e. the cost & effectiveness modelling, and/or bring-your-own data, may prefer to create a user account in order to save for a later date their own input data and models.

::: callout-note
The current version of the tool is ![](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg),  {{< meta tool-version >}} and **returning users** may need to check a locally cached earlier version is not being used. If this is the case, follow your browser instructions to clear the cache and refresh your version of the MAPS tool.
