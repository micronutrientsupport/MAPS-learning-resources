# Professional training in MAPS

This section is under development ![](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg)

QuickMAPS and cost-effectiveness modelling training has been given in a number of learning sessions in openly-accessible conferences, as well as some MAPS-run workshops. The workshops have generally been aimed at those in national nutrition settings, or nutrition research. This document provides examples of the training content that we have built through these experiences. Our workshops/learning sessions have also provided us with iterative co-design, from trainee feedback in the virtual, or in-person, rooms.

## MAPS learning sessions

These sessions held within conferences have all been applied to under open calls for training/learning sessions. These are also listed under the 'Conferences' header on <https://micronutrient.support/publications>
