# About this guide

This guide is intended to provide case study examples where the ***Micronutrient Action Policy Support (MAPS)*** tool has been used in university education, or professional training settings.

The information in this guide is aimed at anyone looking to develop participatory teaching/training in food systems thinking to improve dietary micronutrients, using the MAPS tool as part of the learning activity.

This guide can be read in sequence, or users can use the navigation panels to directly select the educational stage they are interested in.

Complementary guides are provided for the [MAPS tool user guide](https://help.micronutrient.support/ "MAPS tool user guide") and web developers ![work-in-progress](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg).

Further information on the project and project team which created the MAPS tool can be found at the project website <https://micronutrient.support/>. A summary of our co-design process, implemented to design and test the MAPS tool, can be found at \[![](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg)\].
