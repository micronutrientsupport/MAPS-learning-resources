A summary of our co-design process, implemented to design and test the MAPS tool, can be found at [].",

    "text": "2.1 The scope of this guide\nThis guide is aimed at anyone looking to develop participatory teaching/training in food systems thinking to improve dietary micronutrients, using the MAPS tool as part of the learning activity.\nWe provide examples used in university teaching, or professional training, during the MAPS project. We recommend these are adapted to suit local learning needs in any setting where the MAPS tool is relevant. We provide examples from undergraduate, postgraduate and professional level training provided in the MAPS project. This is intended to help guide use of MAPS in similar settings elsewhere.\nWe also summarise our training resources for the R language, in which our “offline” modelling development has taken place.\nThe MAPS tool has been developed to meet the previously unmet needs of users for an “easy to use” system that does not require extensive training; we see this as an advantage in an educational setting as well, because it should maximise the time in which learners can focus on their understanding and interpretation of the data presented.",

    "text": "2.2 Accessing MAPS tool\nThe MAPS tool can be accessed directly from https://maps.micronutrient.support/ or https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool, and via our shortcut https://www.maps.africa/. All three links lead to exactly the same version of the tool.\nThe MAPS tool has been optimised for screen sizes typically found with desktop and laptop devices, rather than smaller mobile devices. Using smaller devices is possible, but will not provide the intended user experience of the interfaces. The tool will work in widely used commercial operating systems and web browsers (as at 2024).\nAccess is free of charge and does not require users to log-in. Users of the full scope of functionality, i.e. the cost & effectiveness modelling, and/or bring-your-own data [], may prefer to create a user account in order to save for a later date their own input data and models.\nThe current version of the tool is &lt;&gt;, and returning users may need to check a locally cached earlier version is not being used. If this is the case, follow your browser instructions to clear the cache and refresh your version of the MAPS tool.",
