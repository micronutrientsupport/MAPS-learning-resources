    "text": "2.1 The scope of this guide\nThis guide is aimed at anyone looking to develop participatory teaching/training in food systems thinking to improve dietary micronutrients, using the MAPS tool as part of the learning activity.\nWe provide examples used in university undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, and professional training, during the MAPS project. These examples are not intended to be prescriptive, but to guide the use of MAPS in similar settings elsewhere.\nWe also summarise our training resources for the R language, in which our “offline” modelling development has taken place, and which underpins modelling in the MAPS tool itself.\nThe MAPS tool has been developed to meet the previously unmet needs of users for an “easy to use” system that does not require extensive training; we see this as an advantage in an educational setting as well, because it should maximise the time in which learners at all stages can focus on their understanding and interpretation of the data presented, rather than learning how to use the tool.",

    "text": "2.2 Accessing the MAPS tool\nThe MAPS tool can be accessed directly from https://maps.micronutrient.support/ or https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool, and via our shortcut https://www.maps.africa/. All three links lead to exactly the same version of the tool.\nThe MAPS tool has been optimised for screen sizes typically found with desktop and laptop devices, rather than smaller mobile devices. Using smaller devices is possible, but will not provide the intended user experience of the interfaces. The tool will work in widely used commercial operating systems and web browsers (as at 2024).\nAccess is free of charge and does not require users to log-in. Users of the full scope of functionality, i.e. the cost & effectiveness modelling, and/or bring-your-own data, may prefer to create a user account in order to save for a later date their own input data and models.\nThe current version of the tool is &lt;&gt;, and returning users may need to check a locally cached earlier version is not being used. If this is the case, follow your browser instructions to clear the cache and refresh your version of the MAPS tool.",

    "text": "3.1 Context\nThis exercise was used as the basis for a group assessed exercise for first year undergraduate students. The groups were drawn together with members from the different agriculture-nutrition degree schemes in the School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, generally with 5-6 members.\nIn addition to their scientific understanding, this assessment included both teaching support for, and assessment criteria of, team-working and presentation skills; these are not included here. The assessment took place in the regular university exam period after all taught components of the course were complete.",

    "text": "3.2 Setting the group exercise\nEach group is presented with a unique nutrient – country combination available in the MAPS tool. This information was shared with students before the first in-person practical session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use only countries with national-scale data. This balances having sufficient information for our learning objectives, whilst keeping the volume of data manageable for the course requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe prioritise nutrients with both large-scale food fortification and biofortification strategies that are reasonably well documented, as well as a dietary change option, in order to provide an equal academic opportunity to all the groups to find examples they can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn undertaking this group exercise, students were encouraged to draw upon their own degree experience complementary to their team colleagues. This was in addition to the common-to-all taught (lecture) component of this module in “sustainable agriculture, food and nutrition”.\nThe taught practical component of this part of the module is described below. In order to complete this assignment, the assignment groups were expected to organise additional sessions to work together.",

    "text": "3.3 Practical sessions\nA computer lab was used to train the approximately 90 students in each cohort, either concurrently or asynchronously depending on room availability and timetabling. The MAPS tool was designed to work efficiently on low-bandwidth systems, with the added benefit that performance was not compromised during the first hands-on session when all 90 students individually connected (at the University of Nottingham).\nThe MAPS practical teaching was generally structured in three blocks lasting 90 to 120 minutes of contact time, as follows:\n\n3.3.1 Session 1\nBackground to the MAPS tool, with additional practical examples of biofortification and large-scale food fortification interventions (lecture), followed by walk-through use of the MAPS tool (participatory).\nThis comprised, walking through selected examples in QuickMAPS https://help.micronutrient.support/QuickMAPS.html. The examples which they tackled were different to any of the country-nutrient combinations which had been preset as an assessment, to avoid a disproportionate benefit to any team(s). In this session the students were shown how to navigate and change selected country-nutrient options. This was followed by individually viewing and collectively discussing the information contained in QuickMAPS baseline and projection pages.\n\n\n3.3.2 Session 2\nReinforcement participatory session using the MAPS tool “QuickMAPS” baseline and projection data. Introduction to online resources supporting large-scale food fortification (LSFF) intervention opportunities.\nThis session was organised with groups seated and working in their assignment teams. Pre-prepared country-nutrient examples from MAPS were discussed (reinforcement of Session 1), with students expected to need less support to navigate the MAPS tool and locate information.\nThis was complemented by an introduction to the Global Fortification Data Exchange GFDx https://fortificationdata.org/, which presents data on large-scale food fortification for each country globally. MAPS uses input data from GFDx for the cost-effectiveness calculations. Here we introduce the students to GFDx so they can consider fortification opportunities and challenges in the country - nutrient examples used in this session. Students were shown how to navigate the GFDx country dashboards so they could use in the information provided.\nStudents were expected to integrate observations from the MAPS tool (baseline, projections) and GFDx to form narrative (not quantitative) LSFF intervention suggestions that fit with the nutrient in existing food system of the nation being discussed. These were discussed as a classroom, or with tutors moving around the groups, depending on the number of groups in the session.\nThis session provided opportunities to: work as a team; contribute to answering the classroom questions; asking academic staff for any clarifications; and, developing their food systems thinking for the countries they were looking at.\n\n\n3.3.3 Session 3\nReinforcement participatory session using the MAPS tool “QuickMAPS” baseline and projection data. Introduction to online resources supporting biofortification intervention opportunities.\nThis session was organised with groups seated and working in their assignment teams. Pre-prepared country-nutrient examples from MAPS were discussed (reinforcement of Session 1 and 2), with students expected to independently navigate the MAPS tool and locate information (whilst being able to ask for help if they needed it).\nThis was complemented by an introduction to the Biofortification Priority Index (BPI) https://bpi.harvestplus.org/about_using_bpi.html, which presents prioritised data for nations, and documents biofortified crops. Here we introduce the students to BPI so they can consider biofortification opportunities and challenges in the country - nutrient examples used in this session. Students were shown how to navigate the BPI dashboards so they could use in the information provided.\nStudents were expected to integrate observations from the MAPS tool (baseline, projections) and BPI to form narrative (not quantitative) biofortification intervention suggestions that fit with the chosen nutrient in the existing food system of the nation being discussed. These were discussed as a classroom, or with tutors moving around the groups, depending on the number of groups in the session. The student groups were also reminded of the similar approach used for LSFF in the previous session.\n\n\n3.3.4 Example discussion structures\nThese are a selection of structured discussions used in the three sessions, in order to develop thinking around micronutrient deficiencies and feasible intervention options.\n\nExplore data for &lt;country&gt; and &lt;nutrient&gt; in MAPS in QuickMAPS Baseline pages\n\n\nWhat is the nutrient availability, and how does this compared to the harmonised average requirement threshold ?\nWhat differences might be experienced by populations within the country that are masked by the national-scale data?\nWhat might be the underlying cause(s) of these differences?\nWhich foods are the primary source of this nutrient in this country?\nAre these foods all nutrient-dense for that nutrient (a “good source” of the nutrient), or is it because they are eaten in large quantities?\n\n\nNavigate to QuickMAPS Projections for the same country and nutrient:\n\n\nLocate the main graph and discover the text explaining Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP).\nWhat is the expected trajectory for this country-nutrient through time?\nDoes this vary by SSP?\nIs it expected that the nutrient deficiency will vastly improve, or resolve, through time with no additional interventions?\nWhich food groups (the lower graph) contribute to any changes observed in the SSP1-3 trajectores for this nutrient?\nWill there be any differences likely to be experienced within the country population (as in ‘Baseline’ discussion point).\n\nDiscuss what interventions may be appropriate in this food system and why using an example from large-scale food fortification and one from biofortification.",
